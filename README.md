# PortfolioOptimizerApp

## Description
This portfolio optimizer uses the Efficient Frontier method to optimize your portfolio based on historical stock prices from the S&P 500. You can select multiple stocks from the S&P 500, specify the time frame for historical data, and enter the amount you want to invest in the portfolio. The optimizer will then compute the optimal allocation of your investment across the selected stocks, aiming to maximize the portfolio's Sharpe ratio. Additionally, it will display a pie chart showing the allocation of each stock in the portfolio, along with a time series chart comparing the cumulative return of the optimized portfolio with the S&P 500's return.

The application is hosted on streamlit community cloud.
